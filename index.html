        <p class ="paragraph">One thing I think will go back to the way it was before COVID-19 is work 
            and school. People will return to their jobs, and children will go back to school in person, 
            not online. Additionally, I think normal travel will resume. People will still take airplanes 
            over cars because of the convenience, and the airline industry will recover eventually.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">After this pandemic is over, I think people will value their time much more. 
            I would like to think that people will spend more time outside, or more time with their friends. 
            People that have grown into a rythm of going to work and then home and back to work will hopefully 
            find something to fill their time. I also believe that it will change the way that large companies 
            cover their employees with health insurance, and most companies will provide the option to work 
            from home.
